# ðŸ§  Learning, Inference & Memory Lab (LIM Lab)

We study how animals infer patterns and priors from the environment and use them to guide behavior. Our work focuses on:

- **Sensory inference and memory organization**  
- **Neuronal computations underlying learning across timescales**  
- **Integration of priors with sensory inputs and internal models**

Our approach combines:

- High-throughput behavioral training  
- Circuit-level monitoring and manipulation  
- Theory-driven hypotheses and computational modeling
