LIMLab is focused to study the mechanisms and neural principles by which the nervous system computes, represents and integrates various forms of sensory memories and priors in the process of learning and inferring meaningful statistical patterns and abstract relations in the environment.
We will use high-throughput training to combine sophisticated and well-controlled behavioural paradigms with powerful tools to monitor and manipulate neural circuits. In all of our research programs, experiments are intertwined with hypotheses drawn from theoretical investigations.
Drawing on the technical expertise in theoretical neuroscience and neural network dynamics, along with the expertise in rodent cognition, behavioural modelling, imaging, electrophysiological recordings and optogenetics, 
at LIM Lab we aim to bridge our understanding of memory and (statistical) learning at the behavioural level with its implementation at the circuit and systems level.
